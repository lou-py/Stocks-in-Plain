# Stocks-in-Plain
A tiny Streamlit dashboard that pulls price data &amp; news for three semiconductors giants and writes a one‑sentence summary with a free local LLM.

I’m a first–year finance student learning Python. I wanted one mini‑project that touches three buzz‑words every internship posting mentions:

Market data (Yahoo Finance)

Sentiment / NLP (VADER)

Generative AI (Transformers)

Plus, I love semiconductors so I picked ASML, TSM, NVDA.
